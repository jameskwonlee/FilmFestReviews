# FilmFestReviews
Web-Development Project using MEAN Stack.

Intro: Film festivals are a thriving business that make money from indie filmmakers' film submissions. There are currently no review 
websites that provide honest feedback about the venues--the popular ones such as FilmFreeway or Withoutabox are tied to the filmmakers'
submissions to the said festivals. 

So would a filmmaker risk getting their submission rejected, by posting a low review?

FilmFest Reviews allows users to post comments anonymously, under a pseudonym. Just as Yelp keeps small businesses accountable with 
an honest rating system, FilmFest Reviews does the same for all film festivals.
